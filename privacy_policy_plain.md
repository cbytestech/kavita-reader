We don’t collect your data. We don’t sell your data. We don’t send your data anywhere.

Where your info goes

Nowhere. It stays on your device.

If you enable backups, your information is stored by:

Future social features

If we add social features later (like shared libraries or profiles), we’ll store only the info needed for those features on cookiebytestech.com — and this will always be optional.

We’ll update the Privacy Policy before any such features launch.
